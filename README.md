# Python Algorithm
An allow list of IP addresses is used at my company to manage access to content that is forbidden. These IP addresses are identified in the "allow_list.txt" file. The IP addresses that ought to be blocked from accessing this content are listed in a separate delete list. I developed an algorithm to automatically remove these IP addresses that shouldn't be able to access the "allow_list.txt" file and update it.
